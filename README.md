## Tenant Talk

Tenant Talk is a MERN stack web application that allows users to create and read reviews of rental properties. It utilises the Google Places API for location search, Cloudinary for property image storage, and Tailwind and HeadlessUI for the project UI.

## Installation

_Note: Tenant Talk uses MongoDB as it's database, and a great way to visualise this is with the MongoDB Compass GUI, for which full documentation to set up can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)_
